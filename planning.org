#+title: 2024 Hackathon

* Goal
** Host both biologists and computer scientists to have them explore the JUMP dataset for multiple purposes:
*** Biologists have questions, let us pair them with computer scientists to try to find solutions and follow-up questions
*** Facilitate CS to focus on trying to break a benchmark
*** Keep the data and access APIs available before and after

* Registration
** Alongside SBI2/Cytodata.
*** TODO Confirm with Beth that they are happy to add a checkbox within registration

* On-the-day agenda (<2024-09-17 Tue>)
