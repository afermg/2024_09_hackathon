#+title: 2024 Hackathon

* Goal(s)
** Primary goals:
- Biologists have questions, let us pair them with computer scientists to try to find solutions and follow-up questions
- Encourage folks to apply their own methods, knowledge and skills to mine biology
- Facilitate CS to focus on trying to break a benchmark (would require to develop a benchmark)
**** People with a more techincal bioinfo question may want to evaluate the usefulness of the data
**** @Juan: Compound bioactivity (phenotypic activity) to train classifiers. This is evaluable quantitatively. Predicting single assay outcome using witheld subsets of the data. Q: Do these annotations exist for JUMP?
**** GOAL? Attempt to reproduce the annotated hits by building.
** Additional goals
*** For the organisers
- Expose community to the JUMP dataset and its associated tools
- Foster collaborations between biologists and computer scientists
*** For participants
- Learning something new and build (or discover) something that can be followed-up
** Prizes
- Best contribution to an open source library
- Best biological hypothesis/discovery

* Registration
We will have our own registration fee and charge a symbolic amount for the lunch (10).
** Alongside SBI2/Cytodata.
*** NO Confirm with Beth that they are happy to add a checkbox within registration
CLOSED: [2024-05-20 Mon 10:13:20]
** Questionnaire
*** Could you add some tags of interest? These will be used to form interdisciplinary teams.
*** Do you have a specific biological question you aim to answer using JUMP?

** Quick overview
We thrilled to announce that this year, CytoData is joining forces with [SBI2](https://sbi2.org/)! You can take part in the traditional CytoData Hackathon on September 17, and join from September 18-20 for an event supercharged in spatial and morphological profiling.


The main goal of this event is to bring together biologists and computer scientists to use [[https://www.broadinstitute.org/imaging/morphological-profiling][Morphological Profiling]] data to gain novel biological insights. You can bring your own question to the event or get together with experts and come up with one here. The idea is for everyone to have fun, learn how to use morphological data to ask/answer biological questions and meet other scientists with similar interests.

We strongly encourage both biologists to apply, regardless of their expertise in computational methods or their familiarity with the field of morphological profiling.

This event is part of the [[https://sbi2.org/conference/][SBI2]]+[[https://www.cytodata.org/symposia/2024/][Cytodata]] events.

** Registration link
If you want tho register follot [[https://broad.io/hackathon_registration][this]] link, the cost of registration is 20 USD, which aims to cover catering needs.
Due to space constraints, the number of tickets is limited.

** Agenda
The Hackathon will occur on September 17th, 2024 at The Broad Institute's Merkin Building: 415 Main St, Cambridge, MA 02142.

** Prizes
We will offer two different tracks:
- Best new biological story, or, how can we use JUMP to gain novel biological insight?
- Best new tool/method, or, how to make JUMP data more accessible/develop a novel processing technique?

For each track there will be a 500 USD prize in giftcards for the winning team.

** FAQ
*** What is JUMP?
JUMP stands for Joint Undertaking in Morphological Profiling. You can read more about the project [[https://jump-cellpainting.broadinstitute.org/][here]].
*** Can I access the data beforehand?
The data is available right now, and you can see different ways to explore it [[https://broad.io/jump][here]].
*** Are teams assembled there or can I organize my own team?
Both options are valid! The registration form contains a section to indicate whether you come with a team or not.
*** Do you offer fee waivers?
We are unable to do so this time, but keep tabs on future online events and workshops.
*** Can I get in touch with other participants and form a team beforehand?
Yes! The registration form allows you to give consent to share your name, email and interests with the other participants before the event.
*** More questions?
Feel free to send an email to [[mailto:amunozgo@broadinstitute.org][amunozgo@broadinstitute.org]].

** Resources for participants
This section will be updated to concentrate details relevant to participants during the Hackathon.

*** How to get to the Broad Institute?
See the official [[https://www.broadinstitute.org/getting-here][getting here]] webpage.
*** Are there places to eat around?
We will provide lunch and a light breakfast, but there are plenty of cafes and restaurants in the area.
*** Whereabouts in the building will the event take place?
The start and lunch events will occur on the sixth floor section that connects 415 Main St. and 75 Ames (the room is called Serengeti).
For the hacking sessions people will be split between Serengeti and other locations in the M1 floor (Mezzanine)
There will be Broadies from the Imaging Platform who will show you the two floors and bring you to your floors and give you further indications.
