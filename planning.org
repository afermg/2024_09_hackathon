#+title: 2024 Hackathon

* Goal(s)
** Host both biologists and computer scientists to have them explore the JUMP dataset for multiple purposes:
*** Biologists have questions, let us pair them with computer scientists to try to find solutions and follow-up questions
*** Encourage folks to apply their own methods, knowledge and skills to mine biology
*** Facilitate CS to focus on trying to break a benchmark (would require to develop a benchmark)
**** People with a more techincal bioinfo question may evaluate if the data is useful
**** @Juan: Compound bioactivity (phenotypic activity) to train classifiers. This is evaluable quantitatively. Predicting single assay outcome using witheld subsets of the data. Q: Do these annotations exist for JUMP?
**** GOAL? Attempt to reproduce the annotated hits by building.

** Additional goals
*** Expose community to JUMP
*** Raise awareness and exposure to the data
*** Presentations are work in progress
*** (For participants): Learning something new and build (or discover) something that can be followed-up

** Prizes
- Best contribution to an open source library
- Best biological hypothesis/discovery

* Registration
** Alongside SBI2/Cytodata.
*** TODO Confirm with Beth that they are happy to add a checkbox within registration

Total number of working hours: (2 + 2:40 + 2 ) = 6:40

* Logistics
*** Keep the data and access APIs available before and after
** How many people do we expect? (40-60)
** How to split groups?
a) Assemble groups from  bio and cs folks
b)

* Rooms
The number of people they fit is optimistic, not for tables.
