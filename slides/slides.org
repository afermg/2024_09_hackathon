* Introduction
* Overview
** Goals
- Foster collaborations between biologists and computer scientists, to match problems and potential solutions
- Learning something new and build (or discover) something that can be followed-up with further experiments
- Discover new ways to access and discover new ways to process JUMP profiles
  
* Schedule
|                          |        Time |
|--------------------------+-------------|
| Lunch                    | 12:30-13:30 |
| Break                    | 15:20-15:40 |
| Presentations and awards | 17:20-18:20 |

* Some example of ideas, based on known challenges
- How do we connect JUMP information to many other databases?
- Can consistently identify plate layout effects?
  - When corrected, how do we evaluate the adjustments?
- Examples of existing stories can be found 
  
* Rooms available
You can check your team and the associated room on the participants' spreadsheet
- Joshua Tree        
- Badlands           
- Crater Lake        
- Acadia (this room)
