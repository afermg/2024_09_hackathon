* Overview
** Goals
- Foster collaborations between biologists and computer scientists
- Learning something new and build (or discover) something that can be followed-up
- Expose community to the JUMP dataset and its associated tools
  
* Schedule
|                          |        Time |
|--------------------------+-------------|
| Lunch                    | 12:30-13:30 |

| Presentations and awards | 17:20-18:20 |

* Some ideas, based on known challenges
- How do we connect JUMP information to many other databases?
- Can consistently identify plate layout effects?
  
* Teams and their rooms
