* Goals of the event
- Foster collaborations between biologists and computer scientists, to match problems and potential solutions
- Build a new tool to extract biological insights from JUMP, or discover something that can be followed-up with further experiments
- Showcase how to access the latest JUMP morphological profiles and explore new ways to process them
  
* Main items in the schedule
|                          |        Time |
|--------------------------+-------------|
| Lunch                    | 12:30-13:30 |
| Break                    | 15:20-15:40 |
| Presentations and awards | 17:20-18:20 |

* Notes
- The two tracks of the Hackathon are "best tool/method" and "best biological story"
- Teams will spread across the four conference rooms in this floor, including here
- All rooms will be connected on a Zoom call
- Mentors with biological and/or computational expertise will float around to help teams
- If you need to go outside just let us know when you are back to have someone pick you up
- Presentations at the end of the day will be five minutes per team
  
* Evaluation criteria
- Problem definition: Is the biological/technical problem well-defined?
- Creativity: How well does the team leverage existing tools to solve their problem? Are there any out-of-the-box ideas or methods?
- Potential: How much potential does the idea have to become a product (i.e., article, software)
- Execution: The quality of the implementation and presentation.

* Examples of project ideas
- How do we connect JUMP information to many other databases?
- Can we consistently identify plate layout effects?
  - Upon corrections of layout effects, how do we evaluate an improvement?
- Which chemical compounds that result in extreme phenotypes are found in JUMP?
- Specific biological stories (link on =Resources= slide)
